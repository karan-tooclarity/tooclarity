  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Kindergarten</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Kindergarten is the first step in a child’s formal education journey. It acts as a bridge between home or preschool and primary school, focusing on the overall development of children—social, emotional, physical, and intellectual. The term “kindergarten” comes from German, meaning “children’s garden,” symbolizing a nurturing space where young minds grow.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Kindergarten is not just about learning letters and numbers — it’s about helping children develop essential life skills, build friendships, explore their surroundings, and become more independent. Think of it as a gentle bridge between home or preschool and formal primary school.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-6">
    At this stage, children are like little sponges — curious, active, and eager to learn through play, exploration, and interaction. Kindergarten provides them with a safe and stimulating space where teachers guide them through activities designed to build their language skills, social behavior, emotional maturity, and basic academic concepts.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">1. What is Study Hall?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      A study hall is a scheduled period in schools or colleges where students can study independently in a quiet environment. 
      It is not a regular className but a supervised session for completing homework, revising lessons, or preparing for exams. 
      Teachers or staff are usually present to maintain discipline and offer guidance if needed. 
      Study halls encourage students to use their time productively. They help build good study habits and improve focus.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3. How can study halls improve academic performance?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Study halls give students dedicated time to focus on their studies without distractions. They allow students to complete homework, revise lessons, and clarify doubts with teachers or classNamemates. 
      Regular study hall sessions help build better time management and study habits, and reduce last-minute stress before exams by encouraging consistent learning.

  {/* <!-- Difference from Coaching/Tutoring --> */}
  <div className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">4. How is study hall different from a coaching center or tutoring?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      A study hall is a quiet space for students to study independently, often with minimal guidance. 
      In contrast, a coaching center or tutoring involves structured teaching, explanations, and personalized support from instructors. 
      Study halls focus on self-study, while coaching or tutoring focuses on direct teaching and skill improvement.

  {/* <!-- Focus & Time Management --> */}
  <div className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">5. How do study halls help students improve focus and time management?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Study halls provide a quiet, distraction-free environment dedicated to studying. 
      With a set time for self-study, students learn to concentrate better and develop time management skills by planning and completing assignments within the allotted period. 
      Regular use encourages consistent study habits, reduces procrastination, and improves overall productivity.
